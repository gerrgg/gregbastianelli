My personal website backed Wordpress, Built with GatsbyJS and deployed by Netifly.

## Todo

Stuff todo - Maybe do a ~~strikethrough~~ checkbox " - [x] " instead of deleting completed tasks.

### Easy

- Setup site icon (GB)
- Close mobile menu when clicking off / scrolling away
- Add back to top button on mobile
- Setup site with google/duckduckgo (forget gerrg)
- Setup stable branch for auto deploy to gregbastianelli
- Setup analytics (netifly? if free)
- Add filter/order by to archive's

### Maybe Not Easy

- Make header sticky with autohide - slide up when scrolling away, slide down when stop/ scroll up (like FSO)
- (TOC) Detect when pass a header and update url and highlight current section in TOC
- Resume page
- Build/setup a nice 404 page
- Add some cute little animations to links/hover (SpringJS / Keyframes)
- Setup a contact form above the footer
- A Github page with a list of repo's, commits, activity, etc.
- Snippets page which connents to github API
